ABSTRACT
Cryptocurrency represents a form of asset that has arisen from the progress of
ﬁnancial technology, presenting signiﬁcant prospects for scholarly investigations.
The ability to anticipate cryptocurrency prices with extreme accuracy is very
desirable to researchers and investors. However, time-series data presents signiﬁcant
challenges due to the nonlinear nature of the cryptocurrency market, complicating
precise price predictions. Several studies have explored cryptocurrency price
prediction using various deep learning (DL) algorithms. Three leading
cryptocurrencies, determined by market capitalization, Ethereum (ETH), Bitcoin
(BTC), and Litecoin (LTC), are examined for exchange rate predictions in this study.
Two categories of recurrent neural networks (RNNs), speciﬁcally long short-term
memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU), are employed. Four performance
metrics are selected to evaluate the prediction accuracy namely mean squared error
(MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and
root mean squared error (RMSE) for three cryptocurrencies which demonstrates that
GRU model outperforms LSTM. The GRU model was implemented as a two-layer
deep learning network, optimized using the Adam optimizer with a dropout rate of
0.2 to prevent overﬁtting. The model was trained using normalized historical price
data sourced from CryptoDataDownload, with an 80:20 train-test split. In this work,
GRU qualiﬁes as the best algorithm for developing a cryptocurrency price prediction
model. MAPE values for BTC, LTC and ETH are 0.03540, 0.08703 and 0.04415,
respectively, which indicate that GRU offers the most accurate forecasts as compared
to LSTM. These prediction models are valuable for traders and investors, offering
accurate cryptocurrency price predictions. Future studies should also consider
additional variables, such as social media trends and trade volumes that may impact
cryptocurrency pricing.

INTRODUCTION
Cryptocurrency is any virtual or digital currency that is used inﬁnancial systems to
prevent counterfeiting, with encryption serving as the primary form of protection
(Mukhopadhyay et al., 2016; Rose, 2015). It is different from traditional currencies as it is
not controlled by banks or central authorities and because it is decentralized, it may be
converted using some cryptographic techniques (Brenig, Accorsi & Müller, 2015). Another
characteristic that made it feasible is by using a much known technology called blockchain
which stores data that is hard to hack, change or deceive (Eyal, 2017). It is hard to predict
when cryptocurrencies will become extensively used in international markets because they
are still in their infancy (Mäntymäki, Wirén & Najmul Islam, 2020). The widely used
cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC)ﬁrst appeared in 2009 as a trailblazer in theﬁeld of
blockchain technology. For more than two years, it was the only digital money in the
blockchain space. The development of cryptocurrencies is still ongoing and it is still
unclear how widely they will be accepted and integrated in the future. There are already
over 5,000 digital currencies in circulation in the cryptocurrency market and there are an
estimated 5.8 million active individuals involved in it (Jang & Lee, 2017). Because of the
unusual combination of monetary units and encryption technology, BTC has been
attracted from a variety of industries, including economics, computer science and
cryptography. This multidisciplinary effect and expanding relevance of cryptocurrencies in
modern study and conversation are highlighted by combination of differentﬁelds
(Saad et al., 2019).
The core technology of the Bitcoin cryptocurrency system, known as blockchain, is
essential in improving security and privacy different areas, most preferably in Internet of
Things (IoT) environment. Blockchain acts as a digital ledger that distributes the recording
of transactions throughout a network of computer systems in a decentralized manner. The
potential of blockchain technology to transform trust mechanisms and data integrity in
various industries is evident from its use outside of the cryptocurrency space. This
highlights the signiﬁcance of blockchain in inﬂuencing the direction of digital
infrastructure and innovation in the future (Gautam, Sharma & Kumar, 2020; Adams,
Kewell & Parry, 2018). Blocks and transactions are the two main components of a
blockchain. Blocks operate as data collections that record transactions together with
related information like sequence and timestamp, whereas transactions represent
participant activities. Blockchain also includes a signaling system called BloSS, a
cooperative DDoS defense system that operates across several domains using blockchain
technology. In this system, each autonomous system works together as a member of the
defensive alliance. This paradigm emphasizes how blockchain may cooperate with others
to strengthen security protocols in a variety of contexts (Killer, Rodrigues & Stiller, 2019).
According toGandal & Halaburda (2014), there are two factors that inﬂuence how

networks affect competition in the emerging cryptocurrency industry in terms of exchange
rates over time:
(1) competition between various currencies.
(2) competition among exchanges.
Despite the fact that there are hundreds of cryptocurrencies present in the market, but
Bitcoin is the most known as it is a tenacious rival and has not yet broken free from the
cryptocurrency battle. It has thus emerged as the leading cryptocurrency. A competition
was observed among cryptocurrencies as“healthy competition,” supporting continued
breakthroughs in technology and security innovations (Iwamura, Kitamura & Matsumoto,
2014). However,Kyriazis (2019)shows that BTC and conventional national currencies
demonstrate volatility shock transmission and that the phenomena are largely unaffected
by uncertainty in economic policy. These revelations highlight the complex relationship
that exists between cryptocurrencies and traditional monetary systems, highlighting the
role that economic stability and technical robustness will help in determining the direction
that digital currencies will drive in the future. The authors explored how big data and
cryptocurrencies interact, presenting the Bitcoin market as a seductive setting forﬁnancial
speculation (Hassani, Huang & Silva, 2018). It also contributed to the growth of dishonest
practices made possible by social media platforms. This investigation clariﬁes the intricate
relationships between digital currencies, data analytics and the difﬁculties presented by
dishonest activities in the cryptocurrency space. Many people have made signiﬁcant gains
from speculative investments in digital marketplaces. But all investments include some
danger, which is why some investors— especially those who are willing to take on more
risk— tend to invest in cryptocurrencies. As these markets are volatile, market analysts
and speculators rely largely on predictive approaches to navigate and proﬁt from them
(Nizzoli et al., 2020; Rebane et al., 2018).
Utilizing machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms is of moderate
interest, given the variations in predicting effectiveness among various cryptocurrencies.
These cutting-edge technologies provide exciting opportunities for improving prediction
performance in the cryptocurrency space, adjusting to the volatility that are speciﬁc to each
virtual asset (Rehman & Apergis, 2019). Cryptocurrencies that are less volatile than those
that are more volatile are more predictable. Furthermore, different data sets have different
levels of efﬁciency for various ML algorithms andvia using these approaches, it makes
prediction much more complex. This emphasizes the complex issues surrounding Bitcoin
forecasting and how crucial it is to comprehend how volatility levels and prediction
techniques interact (Liew et al., 2019). Even with the use of cryptocurrencies for a variety of
transactions throughout the world, still there is disagreement about the exact meaning of a
cryptocurrency and its legal status. It also highlights how difﬁcult is to categorize and
regulate digital currencies, which reﬂects how legal frameworks are always changing to
keep up with the cutting-edge nature of Bitcoin technology (Dyntu & Dykyi, 2018).
Moreover, the previously indicated situation ampliﬁes the challenges faced in criminal
inquiries concerning cryptocurrency-driven money laundering. Thus, law enforcement
organizations encounter difﬁculties in locating criminals and providing evidence of illegal
activity, which makes it difﬁcult to determine guilt and bring criminal charges against

offenders. This emphasizes how urgently improved regulatory controls and investigative
resources are needed to properly handle illegal activity in the Bitcoin space (Kethineni &
Cao, 2020). Focus on Bitcoin price is similar to focus on stock price, but one important
difference is that cryptographic forms of money are not exposed to similar risk factors that
inﬂuence stock price changes. Furthermore, most of digital forms of money are to a great
extent unaffected by traditional macroeconomic pointers, for example, currency rates, item
costs and larger economic issues affecting conventional assets. The distinct dynamics and
elements inﬂuencing digital asset pricing in the Bitcoin market are highlighted in this
article (Liu & Tsyvinski, 2021).
In the 2017 cryptocurrency market boom, some governments worldwide started to
standardize and regulate digital currency. Due to the safety of blockchain technology,
Bitcoin is now used by more people in a more comfortable manner (Valdeolmillos et al.,
2020). Blockchain technology provides a strong security foundation, but those who use
cryptocurrencies for illegal purposes must also be taken into consideration when
accounting for the legality of cryptocurrencies. As a result, there are continuous
discussions and examinations around the legality of cryptocurrencies. They emphasize
how complex technological innovation, legal frameworks and moral issues interact in
digital currency. The viewpoints and characteristics of cryptocurrencies in respect of
monetary elements, legal and economic issues are discussed by the authors
(Yuneline, 2019). From an economic perspective, Bitcoin does not meet the
requirements of a currency on the basis of the viewpoint and features of traditional
currency. In digital markets, BTC is a well-known cryptocurrency among many. Because
cryptocurrencies have signiﬁcant interrelationships, smaller cryptocurrencies can cause
shocks that can harm larger cryptocurrencies. Based on research (Huynh et al., 2020), gold
acts as a stand-alone currency and can be a useful asset for hedging against
unanticipated changes in the price of cryptocurrencies. This highlights the possibility
that conventional assets, like gold, might operate as stabilizing elements in the
ever-changing world of virtual currencies providing opportunities for risk mitigation
and diversiﬁcation tactics.
The dynamic and inherently volatile nature of cryptocurrencies makes price forecasting
particularly challenging. This study focuses on analyzing three prominent
cryptocurrencies among the many worldwide. By delving into the complexities of these
speciﬁc cryptocurrencies, this research aims to advance the understanding of factors
driving priceﬂuctuations in the cryptocurrency market. Therefore, the following objectives
are established in this study, utilizing machine learning and deep learning algorithms that
can identify latent patterns in data to achieve more precise predictions. The key
contributions of this research are as follows:
. This article presents a comprehensive analysis of deep learning models used to predict
the prices of three cryptocurrencies named Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin.
. Two categories of recurrent neural networks, namely long short-term memory (LSTM)
and gated recurrent unit (GRU), are utilized for cryptocurrency price prediction. The

study leverages these DL algorithms to enhance prediction accuracy and handle the
inherent nonlinearities in time-series data.
. Experimental results represent that GRU model outperforms LSTM model in predicting
cryptocurrency prices for BTC, LTC, and ETH, as indicated by lower MAPE values,
thereby establishing GRU as the more accurate prediction algorithm.

RELATED WORK
Deep learning is a powerful subﬁeld of AI that can predict future eventsvia the analysis of
past data. Its advantage over conventional forecasting techniques is well-established, since
it regularly producesﬁndings that are almost exactly like real results. Additionally,
machine learning’s ability to improve outcome precision is apparent, that is why it is a
favored option in a variety ofﬁelds. Moreover, because of its capacity to recognize intricate
patterns and adjust to changing datasets, ML and DL are becoming a crucial component of
decision-making processes in a variety of sectors (Hitam & Ismail, 2018).
The author’s emphasized beneﬁts of investing in cryptocurrencies using ML algorithms
like neural networks (NN), support vector machines (SVM), and random forests (RF)
(Andrianto & Diputra, 2017). Firstly Bitcoin has shown less standard deviation which
expand the adequacy of methodology. Secondly, cryptocurrencies enable investors to
diversify different investment strategies by giving them access to a wide range of allocation
options. A total of 5% to 20% allocation is the optimal amount for allocation to
cryptocurrencies which depends upon investor preferences and risk tolerance. To enhance
the performance of their holdings, investors tailor their portfolios as per their risk proﬁles
by using this range. The focus of author’s investigation theﬁeld of time series data
forecasting is prediction of BTC value (Derbentsev et al., 2021). Two machine learning
algorithms RF and stochastic gradient boosting machine (SGBM) are used in this article
that explain how well ensemble strategy work in this particular area. The results proved
that these calculations can change the cost of Bitcoin and open-ups various opportunities
for ML in surveying and navigation of digital money. In this study, ML techniques proved
useful and adaptable in forecastingﬁnancial decisions for better understanding in
cryptocurrency market environment. Timely and well informed decisions lessen the risk
associated with investigating cryptocurrency for effective decision making is also
necessary. The authors proposed a hybrid cryptocurrency prediction system that uses GRU
and LSTM models (Patel et al., 2020). The proposed algorithm predicts the trajectories of
two cryptocurrencies namely LTC and Monera. The main aim of research is to improve
understanding of market dynamics by integrating various neural network designs for
intelligent decision making by the investors. The combination of LSTM and GRU model

maximize forecast accuracy and help investors to navigate the Bitcoin market with greater
conﬁdence and efﬁciency. The authors observe the complexity of Bitcoin returns which are
minute-sampled as well as aggregated over 3 h to provide volatility in data (Miura, Pichl &
Kaizoji, 2019). The authors used different ML techniques namely SVM, ANN, GRU,
LSTM to protect value of cryptocurrency on the basis of past samples. Heterogeneous
Auto-Regressive Realized Volatility (HARRV) model is contrasted with these prediction
models after the optimization of the lag values.
The results proved that the proposed model accurately protects the prices which
highlights the potential application in forecasting the cryptocurrency value. In another
work the authors used SVM and linear regression methods to protect the Bitcoin prices
(Karasu et al., 2018). The authors used a time series data set which contains Bitcoin closing
values to construct prediction models. The past data of price is combined with machine
learning methods to provide patterns of Bitcoin values in future. These two models make
well informed decisions for forecasting of cryptocurrency in this digital asset market. The
authors proposed article learning method with gradient mechanism for Bitcoin price
prediction and proposed a regression approach on the basis of correlated attributes (Saad
et al., 2019). The searches focused on the prices of Bitcoin, etherum and Ripple and how it
change in theﬁeld of cryptocurrency analysis. The study emphasis on characteristics of
these models by using AI frameworks like RNN or ANN. This research proved that LSTM
is better at capturing short termﬂuctuations in Bitcoin values whereas ANN is best at
capturing long termﬂuctuations (Yiying & Yeze, 2019). In thisﬁeld, LSTM helps in making
well informed decisions as it can extract information from the past data. This review article
showed various results about day to day value of Bitcoin using high layered information
(Chen, Li & Sun, 2020). A total of 66% is exhibited by both direct discriminant
examination and strategic relapse. But for daily price prediction an advanced ML
algorithm performs much better than conventional techniques. A total of 66% and 65.3%
was achieved by statistical method and ML algorithm respectively. This shows that how ml
methods improve the accuracy of forecasting and provide insights of market and how
predictive analytics is evolving in cryptocurrency markets. Investors looking to move more
precisely and conﬁdently through the unpredictable and complicated world of BTC
trading willﬁnd these insights to be of immeasurable value. The study explores the
effectiveness of neural networks, support vector machine and random forests in
forecasting cryptocurrency prices (Valencia, Gómez-Espinosa & Valdés-Aguirre, 2019).
The study emphasized how machine learning methods can be used in conjunction with
sentiment analysis to anticipate market movements. It also demonstrates that Twitter data
alone can provide predictive power, particularly when it comes to forecasting individual
coins. Curiously, the outcomes showed that NN are the most reliable model among the
models that were examined, beating SVM and RF. It highlights the value of cutting-edge
neural network designs in recognizing the complex correlations contained in
cryptocurrency market data. The most signiﬁcant technique for forecasting BTC values in
the stock market is LSTM model that used Yahoo Finance data (Ferdiansyah et al., 2019).
This work developed a method for anticipating Bitcoin values above $12,600 USD just
followed by prediction. The researchers focused on ML techniques because it is necessary

to make reliable technique for Bitcoin price prediction. The aim of this work is to increase
the accuracy of forecasting Bitcoin prices by using LSTM model that provide stakeholders
with necessary information of digital asset marketIt focus on innovation that shows a
proactive approach to address the challenges associated with market forecasting and
predict the dynamics of stock datasets, a complete method integrated linear and non-linear
time-series components into a hybrid model framework. The amalgamation of CNN and
Sequence-to-Sequence LSTM networks (Seq2Seq LSTMs) proved useful in the non-linear
time series forecast. The data patterns depend on both short-term and long-term
timeframes, which can be captured because of the dynamic modeling made feasible by this
link (Zhao & Chen, 2022). This work offered a comprehensive understanding of market
patterns that improve the adaptability of forecasts of stock market by utilizing the
advantages of CNN and Seq2Seq LSTMs. This integrated method indicates a
comprehension of the different nature ofﬁnancial time series data and a concentrated
effort to construct trustworthy forecasting algorithms that are capable of precisely and
successfully navigating the complexity of stock market movements.
The currencies BTC and LTC, which are quickly gaining popularity for online
transactions globally, are analysed using a multi-straight relapse model that prioritises
cooperative perspectives. The R2 values for LTC and BTC were 44% and 59%, respectively,
according toJain et al. (2018). In this investigation, two distinct LSTM models were
employed: a regular LSTM and an LSTM coupled with an AR(2) model (Wu et al., 2018).
This study showcased a strong LSTM-based forecasting system and concentrated on
predicting daily BTC values. With a lower RMSE of 247.33, the LSTM model with the
AR(2) component fared better than the other model. According to thisﬁnding, adding
autoregressive components to LSTM models might be a practical strategy to improve
prediction accuracy. The review advances our understanding of LSTM-based estimating
techniques in cryptographic money markets by providing clarity on how these models are
generally presented. Stakeholders that want to more precisely and successfully manage
market swings willﬁnd this information helpful. The researchers looked at three distinct
forecasting models for Bitcoin prices: GRU, LSTM, and ARIMA (Yamak, Yujian &
Gadosey, 2019). With a MAPE of 2.76 percent and an RMSE of 302.53, ARIMA showed the
best performance in the studies. The study included two distinct prediction models built
using LSTM and Bayesian optimised RNN to estimate the price of BTC (McNally, Roche &
Caton, 2018). With an RMSE of 8% and an accuracy of 52%, LSTM seems to have
performed better. The prediction of bitcoin exchange rates using LSTM, GRU, and Bi-
LSTM is assessed in this study. Bi-LSTM performs better than the others and produces the
most accurate outcomes. It emphasizes how useful the models are for investors and
suggests that future studies look into other aspects that affect cryptocurrency pricing
(Seabe, Moutsinga & Pindza, 2023). A hybrid LSTM-GRU model is proposed for
cryptocurrency price forecasting using time series analysis. Evaluated on Bitcoin,
Ethereum, and Ripple datasets, it achieves the lowest MSE and RMSE values,
demonstrating high accuracy for future price predictions (Auliyah, 2024).
Analysing the cryptocurrency market’s past priceﬂuctuations is a crucial stage in the
investing process. One of the main tactics that investors have used is building Markov

chains, which comprises generating many decision trees in order to determine
which cryptocurrencies have the highest chance of increasing in value when sold
(Lazo et al., 2019). The writers compared the expected and actual results to determine how
effective this was. Since precise forecasting is essential for investment endeavours, this
study focusses on three different models that are capable of predicting the future
prices of cryptocurrencies. The project aims to construct accurate prediction models by
utilizing artiﬁcial intelligence approaches and machine learning algorithms. The ultimate
objective is to maximize investors’potential for money production in the erratic
cryptocurrency markets by providing them with trustworthy tools to make educated
judgments.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
This research aims to forecast the values of BTC, ETH, and LTC using DL methods
like LSTM and GRU. The study adheres to a particular process for evaluation purposes,
which includes the following steps: (1) gathering historical data for LTC, BTC and ETH;
(2) exploring visualization of data; (3) dividing the dataset into testing and training
datasets; (4) training different model types; (5) evaluating the models; and (6) contrasting
the effectiveness of each model. The section explains the methodologies used during the
study’s pre-processing and modeling stages. Furthermore, the various results of the
prediction plots for some cryptocurrencies have been provided below. Finally, an overview
of the complete research, including analysis and implementation, was presented.
Proposed methodology
In this article, a two-layer network with 100 deep learning layers is built using LSTM
and GRU. The writers depended on a credible source known as CryptoDataDownload,
which provides detailed historical market data for cryptocurrencies. It delivers detailed
organized datasets, which is a vital motivator for undertaking exact analysis in Bitcoin
research. The preprocessing step ensures consistent feature scaling, which is essential for
efﬁcient model training and improves convergence during the learning process. Various
pre-processing methods applied to the cryptocurrency dataset prepared it for deep
learning processing. Normalisation eliminates bias and guarantees that a model is properly
ﬁtted. MinMaxScaler was applied from sklearn to normalize the dataset, scaling features to
a uniform range without distorting value differences. Normalization enhances the models’
data handling capabilities, leading to more reliable and accurate outcomes (Ahsan et al.,
2021; Gupta, 2021). For each cryptocurrency, a train:test split ratio of 80:20 was used to
ensure feature consistency. Data from August 17, 2017 to February 22, 2023 (80% of the
total data) make up the training dataset. On another hand, 20% of the testing dataset’s data
comes from February 23, 2023 to July 10, 2024. Python 3 was used for the studies, along
with pertinent libraries including Matplotlib, Pandas, NumPy, Keras, and scikit-learn.

Dataset description
Figures 2–4, which are separated into training and testing datasets, show the daily closing
values of three cryptocurrencies, namely ETH, LTC, and BTC. The dataset used in this
study is publicly available and was sourced from CryptoDataDownload, speciﬁcally from
the Binance exchange. To exclude repetitive data from the early days of cryptocurrencies,
only historical data from the previous seven years were incorporated. The authors
observed that the prices of each currency have generally increased and decreased over the
time series.
Bitcoin price prediction graph is shown inFig. 2, with“Train” (blue) and“Test”
(orange) values. Dates from 2021 to 2024 are represented on x-axis while BTC values are
displayed on y-axis between 0 and 70,000 USD. A prediction model is trained using
historical BTC values over the“Train” period, which runs from early 2021 to late

2023. When BTC prices peaked in late 2021, they were close to 20,000 USD and by the
end of 2023, they hadﬂuctuated and recovered somewhat. Starting in late 2023 and
lasting until mid-2024, the“Test” period incorporates pricing projections derived from the
model. Prices increased signiﬁcantly during this time, rising from roughly 20,000 USD to
over 70,000 USD, demonstrating signiﬁcant growth.

Figure 3shows Ethereum price forecast graph; orange numbers for“Test” and blue for
“Train” The x-axis shows the range of dates from 2021 to mid-2024, and the y-axis shows
the prices of Ethereum, which vary from 0 to 5,000 USD. The historical Ethereum price
“Train” period chart, which runs from early 2021 to late 2023, is shown below. It is used to
train a prediction model. The price of ether fell to roughly $1,000 in the middle of 2022
from a peak of almost $4,500 in late 2021. After that, there were ups and downs until the
end of 2023, when there was a brief period of stability. The model price forecasts are
accessible from the end of 2023 to the middle of 2024, which is known as the“Test”
period. Prices increased signiﬁcantly at this time, rising from roughly 1,500 USD to over
4,000 USD; this indicated a noticeable upward trend in prices.
A line graph representing the historical and predicted values of LTC during a certain
time period is displayed inFig. 4. The price, which is assumed to be between $50 and $300,
is deﬁned by the y-axis, while the x-axis speciﬁes the time period, which runs from mid-
2021 to mid-2024. The preparation information (“Train”) and the test information
(“Test”) are the two sections that make up the diagram. The blue training data represent
the actual historical values of LTC from mid-2021 to late-2023. Within this time frame,
there could be signiﬁcant swings, with the price reaching a high of over $250 in late 2021
and then generally falling with a lot of volatility. From late 2023 to mid-2024, the orange
test data, which represents the anticipated pricing, is displayed. The anticipated prices
exhibit little volatility within the speciﬁed timeframe, indicating a more stable future price
trend for LTC.
Deep learning and statistical analysis rely upon the capability to interpret the
distribution of a dataset. Using visual tools, the data’s patterns, trends and abnormalities
can be quickly identiﬁed. The precision of models and decision-making process can both

be improved by these revelations. Additionally, by making complicated information easier
to comprehend and available, visualizations may improve stakeholder comprehension and
cooperation. The data of time series for LTC, BTC, ETH from August 17, 2017, to June 10,
2024, is displayed inFig. 5. The time frame was selected to ensure that there were enough
dataset items to feed the deep learning models.
A sample of data from the selected cryptocurrency dataset used in this work is shown in
Fig. 6. The data properties and distributions of the cryptocurrencies are also shown. A clear
picture of the sample data is provided by this visualization, which also serves to draw
attention to trends or patterns that could be pertinent to the work.
The correlation matrix shows the correlation coefﬁcient between two cryptocurrencies
which tells how changes in single variable’s value impact changes in another. When
changes in one variable match changes in another, the changes are seen as correlated. So,
the variables are considered substantially associated if the value of correlation coefﬁcient is
more than 0.5. The closing values of BTC, LTC and ETH show a positive link, according to
the correlation matrix inFig. 7. Because of their strong connection, it is likely that the
prices of the other cryptocurrencies will move in the same way if the price of one of them
increases or decreases.
Deep learning algorithms
This section shows two types of DL models, namely, long short-term memory and gated
recurrent unit (Chung et al., 2014; Yang, Yu & Zhou, 2020; Hochreiter & Schmidhuber,
1997). LSTMs are more versatile and ideal for complex sequences, whereas GRUs are more
computationally efﬁcient.

Long short-term memory
An improved RNN architecture, namely, LSTM is intended primarily to tackle the
vanishing gradient problem and deal with the problem of long term dependence. An
information-regulatory system built into LSTMs allows information to be stored for long
periods (Yang, Yu & Zhou, 2020). To put it brieﬂy, the architecture of LSTM consists of
many memory blocks that are connected sub-networks recurrently. Every single one of
these memory blocks is essential to the network’s overall operation. Firstly, they are in
charge of preserving the network’s state across time. This indicates that the memory blocks
have a long-term retention capacity, which is critical for activities requiring
comprehension of context across lengthy periods. Secondly, the information that moves
between the cells is controlled by the memory blocks. They manage which data is retained,
updated or removed at each time step, so that the network can efﬁciently recognize and
learn from signiﬁcant patterns without being inﬂuenced by insigniﬁcant information.
These dual functions provide LSTMs the ability to manage long-term dependencies and
alleviate problems like as the gradient problem, which makes them very efﬁcient for a
variety of sequential data applications.

An LSTM model is built using a conﬁguration of 100 neurons for network to recognize
complex patterns in input. A batch size of 32 was used during 20 epochs of training in
order to balance computational effort and learning efﬁciency. A dropout rate of 0.2 is used
during training, arbitrarily deactivating 20% of neurons to reduce overﬁtting. Adam is
optimizer of choice for the optimization process and has an adaptive learning rate that
makes it highly effective. Since the LSTM’s design includes a linear activation function,
which further guarantees extremely accurate continuous value model prediction, it would
be ideal for forecasting time series and other continuous data.
The chain structure of the LSTM architecture comprises four neural networks and
various memory blocks known as cells. The cells store information, and the gates carry out
memory processing. Three gates are present:
. Forget gate: The forget gate eliminates data that is no longer relevant in the cell state. The
gate receives two inputs,xt (input at that speciﬁc moment) andht/C0 1 (output from the
preceding cell), which are multiplied by weight matrices before bias is added. An
activation function sigmoid (σ) is applied to the outcome, producing a binary output. A
piece of information is lost if the output for a certain cell state is 0, but it is kept for later
use if the output is 1. The forget gate’s Eq. (1)is:
ft ¼ r Wf : ht/C0 1; xt½/C138 þ bf
/C0/C1
(1)
where
Wf is weight matrix connected to the forget gate

================================================================================

bf is forget gate’s bias.
. Input gate: The input gate is responsible for adding valuable information to the cell state.
Initially, the sigmoid function is used to regulate the data, and the inputsht/C0 1 and xt are
used toﬁlter the values to be remembered in a manner akin to the forget gate. The tanh
function is then used to construct a vector that contains all of the possible values from
ht/C0 1 and xt and has an output ranging from−1 to +1. Finally, the useful information is
obtained by multiplying the vector values by the regulated values. The input gate’s
Eq. (2)is:
it ¼ r Wi: ht/C0 1; xt½/C138 þ biðÞ : (2)
. Output gate: The output gate is responsible for obtaining valuable information from the
current cell state to be displayed as output. The tanh function isﬁrst used to the cell to
create a vector. The data is then controlled by the sigmoid function andﬁltered by the
values that need to be retained using inputsht/C0 1 and xt. Finally, to be delivered as an
output and input to the following cell, the vector values and the controlled values are
multiplied. The output gate’s Eq. (3)is:
ot ¼ r Wo: ht/C0 1; xt½/C138 þ boðÞ : (3)
Gated recurrent unit
Based on the architecture with LSTM networks, GRU, an extension of RNN was
introduced (Wang, Jiang & Luo, 2016). Like LSTMs, GRUs are also built to handle
arbitrary input sequences of the same length and continue a state that contains
information about past inputs. This means that GRUs has also different operations inside
when compared to LSTMs. LSTMs need more gates and an internal memory cell, whereas
GRUs have a simpler way of controlling the informationﬂow. They have both a reset gate
and one update gate that together decide what should be forgotten GRUs are simpler than
LSTMs as they may be easier to train. Despite their simple architecture, GRUs can perform
as well as LSTMs in many application areas (Yang, Yu & Zhou, 2020).
So, the Penn Treebank dataset showed that GRUs have outperformed LSTM networks
for language modeling. This result goes to prove the superiority of GRUs for noisier
language models. Also, a comparison of natural language processing (NLP) models across
different benchmarks viewed GRUs as competitive to both LSTMs and CNNs (Wang,
Jiang & Luo, 2016). Highlighting the adaptability and strong performance of GRUs across
a range of NLP tasks. Catching long-range connections in consecutive information more
effectively than normal RNNs is one of GRUs’principal beneﬁts. In view of the ongoing
info and the organization’s express, the update and reset entryways in GRUs’plan
empower them to recall or dispose of veriﬁable information speciﬁcally. Selective retention
is essential for activities that require ability to retain and apply knowledge from long
sequences. GRUs, for instance, excel in language translation because they are able to
effectively manage long-term dependencies, which are essential when preserving context

over lengthy text sequences. In light of this element, GRUs are particularly appropriate for
a large number of successive information handling applications, and in certain
circumstances, they even outﬂank clearer RNNs and LSTMs (Yang, Yu & Zhou, 2020).
With 100 neurons in the design, the network can capture complicated sequences and
temporal patterns in the data to build a robust GRU model. With 32 batch size, the training
procedure will span 20 epochs in order to balance resource usage and training
effectiveness. In order to avoid overﬁtting, the Dropout of 0.2 suggests that 20% of
neurones would be switched off during training. Because of the Adam optimizer’s adaptive
learning rate and effectiveness when dealing with sparse gradients, it is used for
optimisation. Because the GRU design employs an additional linear activation in addition
to other methods, it is especially well-suited for tasks like time series forecasting or any
other task that calls for a model to predict continuous values with accuracy. The reset gate
and the update gate are the two gating mechanisms that the GRU has. While the update
gate decides how much of the new input should be used to update the hidden state, the
reset gate decides how much of the prior hidden state should be forgotten. The updated
hidden state is used to calculate the GRU’s output. The followingEqs. (4)–(7) are used to
determine a GRU’s reset gate (rt), update gate (zt), hidden state (ht) and candidate hidden
state (htt):
rt ¼ r Wr: ht/C0 1; xt½/C138ðÞ (4)
zt ¼ r Wz: ht/C0 1; xt½/C138ðÞ (5)
ht ¼ 1 /C0 ztðÞ /C3 ht/C0 1½/C138 þ zt /C3 httÞ (6)
where
htt ¼ tanh Wh: rt /C3 ht/C0 1; xt½/C138ðÞ (7)
Wr, Wz, Wh are weight matrices.
Experimental setup and hyperparameters tuning for models
The algorithms were developed in Python 3 and ran using Google Colab on an HP system.
The Google Colab virtual machine uses a T4 GPU, Python 3, 16 GB GPU memory, 12.7 GB
RAM, and 2 vCPUs, running Ubuntu 20.04 LTS with ~100 GB storage. In order to achieve
the best possible performance for the models, this section presents the hyperparameters
that were used in this investigation. Finding the ideal model architecture parameters that
could be used to anticipate prices is known as hyperparameter tuning. The process of
tuning involves choosing an optimal collection of hyperparameters while taking the
learning algorithm into account (Sharma & Babbar, 2023; Juneja et al., 2024).
Hyperparameter tuning was performed using a systematic approach to ensure valid
comparisons between models. It was performed using random search evaluating
combinations through RMSE and MAE. The research parameters are enumerated as
follows:
. GRU neurons: 100 neurons, optimizing the model’s capacity for learning temporal
dependencies.

. Epochs: 20, with early stopping applied to prevent overﬁtting.
. Batch size: 32, balancing training efﬁciency and model stability.
. Loss function: MSE, RMSE, MAE and MAPE chosen for its effectiveness in regression
tasks.
. Dropout rate: 0.2, used to mitigate overﬁtting by introducing regularization.
. Optimizer: Adam, selected for its adaptive learning rate and robust optimization
performance.
. Activation function: Linear, suitable for the continuous nature of cryptocurrency price
predictions.
Performance metrics
The performance of data is statistically measured by a number of metrics related to it. The
metrics for deep learning models that will be the focus for this study are MSE, RMSE, MAE
and MAPE (Garg et al., 2022; Kazeminia, Sajedi & Arjmand, 2023). The goal is to evaluate
various models and select the best based on the performance metrics that follow:
. Mean squared error: It estimates the average squared difference among real and expected
values. It offers a quadratic loss metric that penalizes greater mistakes more harshly. The
performance of the prediction model improves with a reduced MSE value. MSE helps
improve the accuracy of the GRU and LSTM models for Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum
by efﬁciently penalizing signiﬁcant differences in forecast prices. The mathematical
representation for MSE is mentioned inEq. (8):
MSE ¼ 1
n
Xn

ðAt /C0 ^AtÞ2 (8)
. Root mean squared error: The measurement of the discrepancies between values that a
model predicts and values that are actually observed is called the root mean square error.
It is simpler to read since it gives an error measure in the same units as the target
variable. The prediction model performs better with lower RMSE value. By explicitly
representing the error magnitude in the same units as the values of Bitcoin, Litecoin, and
Ethereum, RMSE offers an interpretable indicator of forecast accuracy for
cryptocurrency prices. The mathematical representation for RMSE is mentioned
in Eq. (9):

. Mean absolute error: It estimates the average absolute difference among real and
expected values. It offers a linear loss measure that does not severely penalize big
mistakes. The prediction model performs better when the MAE value is lower. Without
unduly penalizing signiﬁcant errors, MAE provides a strong evaluation of average

makes it easier to compare their price predictions, allowing for a scale-independent
assessment of model performance.Equation (11)identiﬁes the mathematical

RESULTS
Keras, Sklearn and TensorFlow are various Python libraries used in the proposed DL
model. The tools and frameworks expected for making and reﬁning the models were made
accessible by these libraries. Python 3.9 was utilized to carry out the calculations, ensuring
that it would work with the latest enhancements to the Python programming language. An
interactive platform for coding, troubleshooting, and result visualization was provided by
the programming environment known as Colab. Predicting the actual values of such
cryptocurrencies, including BTC, ETH, and LTC, was the challenge. Numerous deep
learning models have been developed and similarly examined for that reason. The table
provides error values for each model, and comparing the outcomes.
LTC prediction metrics utilizing LSTM and GRU models are displayed inTable 1. With
a lower MSE (0.00029) and RMSE (0.01705), GRU performs better than LSTM, suggesting
higher prediction accuracy. GRU’s MAPE (0.08037) is marginally higher than LSTM’s
(0.07653), and its MAE (0.01272) is marginally higher than LSTM’s (0.01201). All things
considered, GRU offers a more trustworthy prediction model with notable gains in
important error metrics, especially MSE and RMSE. The ETH prediction performance for
LSTM and GRU is shown inTable 2. With a lower MSE (0.00093) and RMSE (0.03051)
than LSTM, which has equivalent values of 0.00124 and 0.03532, respectively, GRU
achieves improved accuracy. In addition, GRU shows somewhat lower MAPE (0.04415)
and MAE (0.02131) than LSTM. Overall, GRU performs better than LSTM, demonstrating
its capacity to more accurately model ETH data with lower prediction error rates on all
measures. The BTC prediction outcomes are evaluated inTable 3. With a substantially
reduced MSE (0.00106vs. 0.00455) and RMSE (0.03258vs. 0.06749), GRU performs
noticeably better than LSTM. Moreover, GRU shows better prediction accuracy with a
signiﬁcantly lower MAPE (0.03540) and MAE (0.02342). The outcomes demonstrate

GRU’s effectiveness in identifying trends and reducing prediction metric errors, making it
the superior model for predicting the price of Bitcoin.
The MSE, MAPE, RMSE and MAE scores were utilized to assess the performance of
LSTM model over LTC, ETH, and BTC data are displayed inTable 1. Among them, the
lowest RMSE was 0.01799 for LTC; the MAE was 0.01201 for LTC; the MSE was 0.00032
for LTC; and the MAPE was 0.05075 for ETC for the model that produced the most
accurate forecast.
Table 2shows theﬁndings for the GRU model on BTC, LTC, and ETH data, which were
analyzed using MSE, MAPE, RMSE, and MAE. It has the lowest LTC RMSE of 0.01705, the
lowest MAE of 0.01272, the highest LTC MSE of 0.00029, and the greatest BTC MAPE of
0.03540.
As a result, GRU had the lowest error numbers and hence had the best performance.
Given its outstanding accuracy in predicting Bitcoin value, the model will provide a useful
tool forﬁnancial forecasting. The thorough analysis and comparison proves GRU as the
best model in this study, yielding accurate predictions based on the available data.

expected price line is shown in red, and the true price line is shown in blue. When the two

the graph when it crosses $100. The anticipated price has a comparable pattern with more
gradual swings, suggesting that the predictive model tends to average out large variances in
the actual pricing.
Figures 9Aand 9B illustrates a graph which shows the loss values over the course of
20 epochs throughout training and testing stages of model for GRU and LSTM
respectively. The y-axis displays loss that ranges from 0 to 0.0175 and 0 to 0.014
respectively, while the x-axis depicts the epochs, which range from 0 to 20. There are two
lines plotted, namely, an orange line for test loss and a blue line for training loss. After the
ﬁrst few epochs, the training loss steadies at roughly 0.0025 after beginning unusually high
at 0.0175. In contrast, the test loss is substantially smaller atﬁrst and stays low throughout
the epochs, averaging approximately 0.0003. The model learns from training data fast, as
proven by large decrease in training loss in early epochs. The capability of model to
effectively generalize to new data is indicated by its continuously low test loss. It also
maintains low error rates during testing, indicating efﬁcient training without overﬁtting.
Results of ETH
Figures 10Aand 10B compares the actual and expected values of Ethereum over time for
GRU and LSTM, respectively. Time is denoted by x-axis, whereas price is shown on y-axis.
The projected prices are displayed in red and the actual prices are displayed in blue. At
ﬁrst, the forecast closely tracks the actual price, catching both the general trend and the
swings. There are very little variations, particularly during abruptﬂuctuations in price,
since the model seeks to level out the highs and lows. This pattern can be seen at the 100
and 150 time points, where the forecasts do not completely reﬂect big spikes and falls in the
real prices. When predicting the overall direction and size of priceﬂuctuations, the model
does a good job. The model’s resilience is seen in the later portion of the graph, as it adapts
to sudden price rises and ensuing stability. The model’s ability to anticipate the overall

trend, even with small errors during turbulent times, suggests that it may have some use in
projecting Ethereum values.
Figures 11Aand 11B displays a model’s training and testing loss during a period of

the loss is denoted by y-axis. The testing loss is displayed in orange, while the training loss
is displayed in blue. The training loss is considerable at the start (epoch 0), suggesting that
the model has difﬁculty ﬁtting the data atﬁrst. But in theﬁrst few epochs, the training loss
rapidly drops and stabilizes at a lower value around epoch 5. Following this, there are a few
slight variations in the training loss but overall it stays low, meaning the model is
successfully learning from the training set. On the other hand, with very modest

ﬂuctuations, the testing loss starts low and stays low throughout the epochs. This
consistency indicates that it is not overﬁtting on training set and can generalizeﬁt to fresh
data. The model performs well and continues to generalize with low loss values on both
training as well as testing data sets.
Results of BTC
Figures 12Aand 12B shows the historical realvs expected values of Bitcoin for GRU and
LSTM respectively, with time represented by x-axis and price by y-axis. The projected
prices are displayed in red and the actual prices are displayed in blue. Atﬁrst, the forecast
captures the overall increasing trend and matches the real price. But with time, especially
during times of signiﬁcant priceﬂuctuations, the projected costs start to fall short of the
actual prices. The real prices exhibit enough volatility that the projections are unable to
completely reﬂect at the 100 and 150 time points. A portion of the real prices’higher peaks
and lower troughs are missed by the prediction line, which has a tendency to smooth out
price variations. This suggests that although the model does a good job of capturing the
general trend and direction, it has trouble correctly predicting the size of abrupt price
swings. Though it might use some tweaks to better manage volatility, the model does a
respectable job of protecting the overall direction of Bitcoin values despite these disparities.
Figures 13Aand 13B displays a machine learning model’s testing and training loss over
a period of 20 epochs for GRU and LSTM respectively. The epoch count is shown by x-axis
whereas the loss is denoted by y-axis. The model learns fast from training data, as seen by
the somewhat large initial training loss that immediately lowers during theﬁrst few epochs.
Following this sharp decline, the training loss steadily levels out and stays low, indicating
that model is becoming better and adjusting to the training set more effectively. Results
acquired from this study demonstrate that GRU model outperformed the LSTM model
when it came to predicting the prices of all cryptocurrencies.

DISCUSSION
For cryptocurrency prediction, this study’s proposed model can be regarded as acceptable
and reliable.Table 4shows how this article’s proposed model comparison to other models
of the literature.
GRU and LSTM were used for cryptocurrency price prediction because they can handle
complicated sequential data while overcoming standard RNN constraints such as
vanishing gradients. LSTM’s gated methods enable excellent long-term dependency
modeling, but GRU provides equivalent performance with less computing complexity.
Unlike transformers, which are resource-intensive, GRU and LSTM are suitable for small
datasets and latency-sensitive jobs. These models achieve a mix between strong temporal

modeling and computing efﬁciency, making them excellent for forecasting Bitcoin,
Litecoin, and Ethereum values. The outcomes show that the GRU model outperforms the
LSTM model in terms of forecasting the prices of BTC, ETH, and LTC. GRU consistently
produces lower error levels across all cryptocurrencies, according to an examination of the
two models using error metrics like RMSE, MAE, MSE, and MAPE. For example,
compared to LSTM, the GRU model obtains the lowest RMSE of 0.01705 for LTC and a
lower MAE of 0.01272 for LTC, compared to 0.01201 for LSTM. Theseﬁndings
demonstrate that GRU performs better in identifying price patterns and providing more
precise forecasts. Apart from the reduced error metrics, the loss values displayed
throughout the training and testing stages clearly demonstrate the GRU model’s superior
generalization capabilities. While the test loss is consistently low throughout,
demonstrating successful learning and avoiding overﬁtting, the training loss of GRU
rapidly decreases after a few epochs and stabilizes at a low value. LSTM, on the other hand,
shows a larger test loss, indicating less effective generalization to unknown data.
Although it has trouble predicting the entire magnitude of abrupt price spikes or
decreases, the GRU model also does a good job at capturing the general trend of price
swings for BTC, ETH, and LTC. GRU tends to smooth out excessive changes, which is
especially evident when comparing the anticipated and actual values inﬁgures for all
cryptocurrencies. The study emphasizes how much better GRU is at predicting Bitcoin
prices in terms of both accuracy and generalization. According to these results, GRU may
be a strong model forﬁnancial forecasting that provides more accurate and consistent
outcomes in erratic markets such as cryptocurrency.

LIMITATION
. Restricted cryptocurrency scope: Because the study primarily examines the three most
important cryptocurrencies— BTC, ETH, and LTC— it may be unable to reliably forecast
how other, less liquid, or new cryptocurrencies will behave.
. Absence of feature diversity: If the model just considers historical prices or currency
rates, it may neglect important variables such as transaction volume, market sentiment,
or macroeconomic data.
. Lack of exogenous factors: The model may not account for external factors that have a
signiﬁcant impact on Bitcoin pricing, such as regulatory changes, social media inﬂuence,
or worldwideﬁnancial events.
. Limited comparisons to other models: This study does not analyze traditional statistical
techniques or simpler, non-neural network models such as ARIMA, which could offer
light on the relative beneﬁts of LSTM and GRU.
. Metrics for Evaluation: The study focusses primarily on the MAE, MSE, MAPE and
RMSE metrics, which may not truly reﬂect how well the model performs in real-world
trading settings where risk and proﬁt are more relevant factors.

Two architectures of recurrent neural networks, namely, LSTM and GRU were utilized in
this work that predict the BTC, LTC, and ETH values, three distinct cryptocurrency types.
The four metrics used to evaluate the models’performance were MSE, RMSE, MAPE and
MAE. The setup includes data normalization using MinMaxScaler and model evaluation
using a variety of metrics and both models were trained using Python libraries like Keras
and TensorFlow. GRU model performed better than LSTM for ETH and BTC, as it has
lower error metrics in most categories (MAPE values-0.03540 for BTC, 0.04415 for ETH,
and 0.08037 for LTC). For ETH, LTC, and BTC, the RMSE for GRU model was 0.03051,
0.01705, and 0.0325, respectively. In GRU model, the MSE for BTC was 0.00106, ETH was
0.00093, and LTC was 0.00029. For BTC, ETH, and LTC, the GRU model’s MAE was
0.02342, 0.02131 and 0.01272, respectively. Therefore, based on the provided metrics, the
GRU model is generally the best choice. The lower and more consistent test loss relative to
training loss shows that the GRU model can handle unseen data more efﬁciently, and it
also showed a faster convergence rate and improved generalization to new data. The
experimental outcomes proved that artiﬁcial intelligence is reliable and satisfactory for
prediction of cryptocurrency. In future, utilizing pre-trained models on similarﬁnancial
datasets may improve the predictive capabilities of the models when transfer learning
techniques are used. The impact of market sentiment analysis, macroeconomic indicators
and social media trends on cryptocurrency prices could be investigated to improve
prediction accuracy in further research.
