networks approaches
Seng Hansun1*  , Arya Wicaksana1 and Abdul Q. M. Khaliq2 
Introduction
As a relatively new type of currency introduced in the new millennium, cryptocurrency 
is a digital or virtual currency that employs advanced encryption techniques in man -
aging and regulating its currency units [1]. It heavily relies on blockchain technology. 
Hence it inherits the blockchain’s properties, such as decentralization, transparency, 
and immutability [2]. No single party or authority controls cryptocurrency transactions, 
making it an exciting option for many people to use and invest in it.
The first and most popular cryptocurrency to date is Bitcoin. It was established based 
on the concept introduced in Satoshi Nakamoto’s publication in 2008 entitled ‘Bitcoin: 
a Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System’ [3], which was later implemented as an open-
source code and released for the public on SourceForge [4]. The concept was widely 
accepted and adopted in various applications, helped shape the cryptocurrency ecosys -
tems, and gave birth to many other cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum, Ripple, Monero, 
Stellar, Litecoin, and Dash [2]. Figure  1 shows Bitcoin’s and several other cryptocurren -
cies’ prices in the last few years, together with their growth percentages.
Abstract 
As a new type of currency introduced in the new millennium, cryptocurrency has 
established its ecosystems and attracts many people to use and invest in it. However, 
cryptocurrencies are highly dynamic and volatile, making it challenging to predict 
their future values. In this research, we use a multivariate prediction approach and 
three different recurrent neural networks (RNNs), namely the long short-term memory 
(LSTM), the bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM), and the gated recurrent unit (GRU). We also 
propose simple three layers deep networks architecture for the regression task in this 
study. From the experimental results on five major cryptocurrencies, i.e., Bitcoin (BTC), 
Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA), Tether (USDT), and Binance Coin (BNB), we find that 
both Bi-LSTM and GRU have similar performance results in terms of accuracy. However, 
in terms of the execution time, both LSTM and GRU have similar results, where GRU is 
slightly better and has lower variation results on average.

As can be seen from Fig.  1a, cryptocurrencies prices are very dynamic, making it a 
challenging task to predict the future values of cryptocurrencies. Moreover, cryptocur -
rencies are also highly volatile, with sudden rises and dips over time, as shown in Fig.  1b, 
caused by many factors. Therefore, the trading community needs an accurate prediction 
method in helping them make strategic decisions and benefit from their investment [6].
Several prediction techniques were introduced in previous studies, but they can be 
mainly grouped into two approaches: traditional empirical analysis and machine learn -
ing algorithms [7, 8]. In the traditional empirical analysis, various statistical methods 
ranging from a simple one (such as moving average) to very complex analyses (such 
as hidden Markov model and sentiment analysis techniques) had been applied to pre -
dict the cryptocurrency prices movement [9]. Several studies that had a focus on this 
approach are Anupriya and Garg [10], Abraham et al. [11], Mohapatra et al. [12], Nasir 
et al. [13], Bakar and Rosbi [14], and Wolk [15].
On the other hand, the machine learning approach was widely applied in various 
fields, including for predicting cryptocurrency prices. Radityo et al. [16] tried to predict 
the Bitcoin exchange rate to USD using artificial neural networks (ANNs). Four types 
of ANNs were compared where they found that the backpropagation neural network 
(BPNN) method is the best method that gives relatively low mean absolute percentage 
error (MAPE) and shortest training time. Phaladisailoed and Numnonda [17] also had 
tried to predict the Bitcoin price. However, they used other machine learning methods, 
namely Theil-Sen regression and Huber regression, and even two deep learning meth -
ods, namely long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU). Their 
experimental results on 2195 daily trading exchange data (BTC/USD) found that GRU 
got the lowest mean square error (MSE) and highest R-square values at 0.00002 and 
0.992, respectively. Recently, Akyildirim et  al. [18] published their work in predicting 
cryptocurrency returns using several machine learning methods, such as support vector 
machine (SVM), logistic regression, artificial neural networks, and random forest. In this 
study, their focus was not only on one cryptocurrency price but twelve cryptocurrencies’ 
prices. They found that the SVM is the best performing method that gives consistent 
results. Some other researchers also tried to develop ensemble methods in tackling the 
cryptocurrency price prediction, as seen in the works of Sin and Wang [19] and Ji et al. 
[20].

In this research, we will further apply and analyze three popular deep learning meth -
ods that are classified as recurrent neural networks (RNNs). They are the long short-
term memory (LSTM), the bi-directional LSTM, and the gated recurrent unit (GRU). 
Although several studies had employed those methods, most of them focused on the 
univariate prediction model, whilst in this research, we will put our focus on the mul -
tivariate prediction model. Moreover, we also use five major cryptocurrencies accord -
ing to the market capitalization, i.e., Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA), 
Tether (USDT), and Binance Coin (BNB) [21]. Hence, several contributions of this 
research are: (1) we propose simple three layers network architecture for regression task 
in predicting cryptocurrencies’ prices, (2) we compare and analyze the proposed archi -
tecture on three popular RNNs, namely LSTM, Bi-LSTM, and GRU models, (3) we use 
the multivariate approach on five major cryptocurrencies and evaluate their results, and 
lastly, (4) we run the proposed architecture on each model several times to get robust 
evaluation results.
The organization of this paper is structured as follows. The data collection and three 
RNNs as deep learning methods used in this research will be explained shortly. Next, the 
pre-processing steps, experimental results, and discussion will be given in the following 
section. Finally, some concluding remarks and suggestions for future research direction 
will end the paper.
Data collection and research method
We start this section by explaining the data collection source and their characteristics. 
Next, a brief description of three popular RNNs models, namely LSTM, Bi-LSTM, and 
GRU, will be given. In the end, an explanation of three commonly used prediction error 
criteria, i.e., mean absolute error (MAE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and 
root mean square error (RMSE), as the performance evaluation metrics used in this 
research will be delivered.
Data source and characteristics
We focus our study on five major cryptocurrencies based on their market capitalization 
[21]. They are Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA), Tether (USDT), and 
Binance Coin (BNB). We collected the daily recorded data of each cryptocurrency price 
against USD from Yahoo! Finance [22] and took the maximum available data from the 
source. Each collected dataset contains seven attributes with different data types, namely 
Date (date), Open (float), High (float), Low (float), Close (float), Adj Close (float), and 
Volume (int). Since each cryptocurrency was introduced and recorded in different time, 
the start date of available data for each cryptocurrency will be differed each other. This 
also results in different number of total records being studied for each cryptocurrency. 
The characteristics of collected datasets are shown in Table 1.
Long short‑term memory (LSTM), bidirectional LSTM (Bi‑LSTM), and gated 
recurrent unit (GRU)
As an improved version of feedforward neural networks, the recurrent neural networks 
(RNNs) can keep past information by taking previous layers’ output as input for the next 
layer in the networks [23]. However, it cannot learn a too-long memory contained in the

networks and suffers the long-term dependency problem [24]. Therefore, a special type of 
RNNs was introduced by Hochreiter and Schmidhuber that could solve the problem [25]. 
Later, the proposed method was called the long short-term memory (LSTM) model and 
was widely used in various applications, including solving regression tasks, such as time 
series prediction.
To store the state in the networks, LSTM uses a three gates mechanism. The first gate 
is the forget gate ( ft ) that controls the degree of information loss from the previous cell’s 
hidden state. The second gate is the input gate ( it ) that controls the degree of new informa-
tion that will be stored in the current cell state. Lastly, the third gate is the output gate ( ot ), 
which calculates the new output value for the current cell [26]. Figure 2 illustrates the three 
gates mechanism in an LSTM cell, while several related equations used in an LSTM cell are 
shown as Eqs. (1–6).

Here, ˜C t is the candidate cell state and C t is the current cell state. All networks’ weights 
are denoted as W f, W i, W C , W o, U f, U i, U C , U o and bias variables as bf, bi, bC , bo . ht rep-
resents current hidden state value and xt represents new information at the current cell. 
Two types of activation functions are used here, i.e., the sigmoid ( σ ) and the tangent 
hyperbolic ( tanh ) activation functions. They are the most frequently used nonlinear acti-
vation functions in artificial neural networks [27].
A newer version of LSTM, called the bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) model, was intro-
duced later. In Bi-LSTM, the bidirectional structure of RNNs is employed. Therefore, rather 
than one forward direction hidden layer, two hidden layers with similar output and inverse 
directions are used [29], as shown in Fig.  3. When the networks have learned from both 
directions separately, their output will be combined by using any merge modes available for 
Bi-LSTM [30]. In this study, we used the default merge mode in Bi-LSTM, i.e., the concat-
enation mode. By using this approach, both past and future information contained in the 
dataset can be preserved [31].
Another type of RNNs recently introduced by Cho et al. [33] is known as the gated recur-
rent unit (GRU). It is pretty similar to LSTM; however, it uses fewer gates and simpler equa-
tions. It combines LSTM’s forget and input gates into a single update gate and merges the 
cell and hidden states [6 ]. Four equations are incorporated in the GRU cell as shown in 
Eqs. (7–10) below.

Here, zt and rt are the update and reset gates, W z and W r are the networks’ weights, ˜ht is 
the current memory state, ht is the final memory or output of the GRU unit to be passed 
on to the next unit, and xt is the new information at the current cell. Figure  4 shows a 
GRU cell and its gates.
Performance evaluation
To evaluate the prediction results, we use three popular error criteria, i.e., mean abso -
lute error (MAE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and root mean square error 
(RMSE). In MAE and RMSE, the degrees of error are given in a unit value, whilst in MAPE, 
the degree of error is given in a percentage value. Equations (11–13) represent those three 
error measurements where a smaller score implies better prediction results [35, 36].
Here, the total number of data is denoted as n , the actual observed value is denoted as Y t , 
and the predicted value is denoted as Ft.

Results and discussion
In this section, we will explain the pre-processing and model development phase 
taken in the study. Next, several examples of the prediction plot results of each cryp -
tocurrency are shown, followed by the performance results and analysis of this study.
Pre‑processing and model development
We conducted several pre-processing steps for each cryptocurrency data, starting 
from data imputation to handle missing values to data reshaped so that it can be pro -
cessed by the deep learning methods applied in this study, namely LSTM, Bi-LSTM, 
and GRU. Firstly, out of seven data attributes, we dropped the Adjusted Close attrib -
ute and focused on predicting the Close value as the target feature. Hence, rather than 
a univariate prediction approach, we used a multivariate prediction model in this 
study by incorporating the Close, Open, High, Low, and Volume data attributes. Next, 
we checked for missing values found in the dataset and used a simple data imputation 
technique by replacing the missing values with their previous known records. Then, 
we normalized all data features using a MinMaxScaler transformation and reframed 
the dataset as a multivariate model. The next step is to split the data into training and 
test sets. We used an 80:20 ratio for training: test for each cryptocurrency. Lastly, we 
reshaped both those sets into 3D-array shapes to be further used in the deep learning 
model development phase.
In this study, we propose simple three layers networks architecture to be used in 
each deep learning model. We argue that simple networks architecture could achieve 
comparable performance results with deeper and complex ones, especially for regres -
sion tasks in the time series domain. Our proposed three layers architecture consists 
of one considered deep learning layer (LSTM, Bi-LSTM, or GRU) with 100 neurons, 
one Dropout layer that will drop 10% of processed information, and one Dense layer 
with one neuron as the output. During the networks’ compilation, we used mean 
square error as the loss function and Adam optimizer. The deep learning model will 
be trained for 50 epochs with 32 batch sizes each run.
The model was trained and run on Google Colab with a single core (two threads) 
 Intel®  Xeon® Processors @ 2.20 GHz,  ~ 12.69 GB RAM, and  ~ 107.72 GB disk spaces. 
In conducting the experiments, we used Python 3 and several core libraries, such as 
NumPy for numerical computing, Pandas for data processing and analysis, Matplotlib 
for data visualization, Keras and scikit-learn (sklearn) for the deep learning applica -
tion programming interface (API) in Python.
Prediction results
After we trained each cryptocurrency dataset on the proposed deep networks archi -
tecture, we tested it on the test set for evaluation. The model development and evalu -
ation were run ten times for each deep learning network (LSTM, Bi-LSTM, and GRU) 
to get robust evaluation performance results. The prediction results were plotted as 
shown in Figs.  5, 6, 7 for each deep learning model (only the first run was shown). The 
blue line shows the actual value, while the red line shows the predicted value. As can 
be seen from the plotted results, each approach (LSTM in Fig.  5, Bi-LSTM in Fig.  6,

and GRU in Fig.  7) gives similar results and could follow each cryptocurrency pattern. 
Further discussion and analysis of the prediction results are given in the following 
sub-section.
Analysis
We used three popular error measurement criteria in conducting the evaluation, i.e., 
MAE, RMSE, and MAPE. Ten consecutive runs were conducted for each deep learning 
method and each cryptocurrency pair, and the mean error values were recorded. Table 2 
shows the error measurement results of each cryptocurrency pair. The lowest score of 
each pair is shown in bold text.
The performance evaluation using MAE and RMSE gave similar results. For USDT-
USD and BNB-USD, the deep networks architecture trained using LSTM gave the best 
results on average at 0.0025/0.0034 (MAE/RMSE) for USDT-USD and 18.0877/27.6245 
for BNB-USD. Bi-LSTM, on the other hand, gave the best result on average at 
100.1383/147.8453 for ETH/USD. Meanwhile, for both BTC-USD and ADA-USD, the 
GRU method achieved the best results at 1167.3462/1777.3070 and 0.0782/0.1134, 
respectively.
We got a slightly different result when the performance evaluation was measured 
by MAPE. For the ETH-USD cryptocurrency pair, which was previously got the best 
results when trained using Bi-LSTM, now when measured using MAPE, the best result 
was achieved by GRU. In fact, GRU is the preferred deep learning method among those

three RNNs, which gave the lowest MAPE score at 0.0447 on average between those five 
considered cryptocurrencies. Bi-LSTM is slightly worse than GRU in the performance 
evaluation using MAPE, while LSTM is the worst. The boxplot diagram that shows the 
MAPE comparison is illustrated in Fig. 8.
To further determine whether the performance results between each applied 
deep learning method are significantly different or not, we conducted a paired 
sample t-test. A Microsoft Excel add-in named ‘data analysis toolpak’ [37] was 
used. Using the tool, we compared the MAE, RMSE, and MAPE results between

LSTM—Bi-LSTM, LSTM—GRU, and Bi-LSTM—GRU. The paired sample t -test 
results are shown in Table  3. It can be seen that the two-tailed p -values for all com -
parisons are more than the significance level at 0.05. Therefore, although GRU is the 
preferred method based on the error measurement criteria results, the difference in 
performance results between each deep learning method is not significantly differ -
ent from each other.
We also recorded the execution time for model development of each considered 
method in this study during the experiment. Table  4 shows the recorded aver -
age execution time for ten runs of each model on each cryptocurrency. As can be 
inferred from the results, the LSTM method needs a shorter execution time for 
model development than the Bi-LSTM method. However, GRU is the better method 
among those three RNNs that gives the shortest execution time at 7.5791 on average, 
which was slightly better than LSTM at 7.9768 on average. It seems that both LSTM 
and GRU have similar performance in terms of execution time, while Bi-LSTM is the 
worst. Figure  9 depicts the execution time comparison for each RNNs deep learning 
method in a Boxplot diagram.
Lastly, we compare the performance results of the proposed approach with other 
similar studies in predicting future cryptocurrencies values. Table  5 shows the rela -
tive comparison of similar studies based on the best average MAPE results. Our pro -
posed approach seems to compete with other more complex methods pretty nicely.

Conclusion
We have proposed simple three layers deep networks architecture to be used and com -
pared among three popular RNNs, namely the long short-term memory (LSTM), the 
bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM), and the gated recurrent unit (GRU). We used a mul -
tivariate prediction model approach on five major cryptocurrencies against USD while 
performing a robust evaluation by running the proposed networks architecture ten 
times. We found that both Bi-LSTM and GRU have similar performance results in aver -
aged MAPE from the experimental results. LSTM could get better results for USDT-
USD and BNB-USD, but it also has greater variation than Bi-LSTM and GRU. Moreover, 
LSTM and GRU have similar results in terms of execution time, where GRU is slightly 
better and has lower variation results on average.
To get better prediction results, specific experiments on the deep networks architec -
ture for each cryptocurrency pair could be conducted. Moreover, in this study, we used 
the default merge mode (concatenation) for Bi-LSTM. Another study to compare the 
effect of various merge modes for Bi-LSTM in predicting cryptocurrency can be done. 
Similarly, the effect of different activation functions used in the model development 
could also be taken for future research.
