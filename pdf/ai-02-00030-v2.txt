Abstract: Cryptocurrency is a new sort of asset that has emerged as a result of the advancement
of ﬁnancial technology and it has created a big opportunity for researches. Cryptocurrency price
forecasting is difﬁcult due to price volatility and dynamism. Around the world, there are hundreds
of cryptocurrencies that are used. This paper proposes three types of recurrent neural network
(RNN) algorithms used to predict the prices of three types of cryptocurrencies, namely Bitcoin
(BTC), Litecoin (LTC), and Ethereum (ETH). The models show excellent predictions depending on
the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). Results obtained from these models show that the
gated recurrent unit (GRU) performed better in prediction for all types of cryptocurrency than the
long short-term memory (LSTM) and bidirectional LSTM (bi-LSTM) models. Therefore, it can be
considered the best algorithm. GRU presents the most accurate prediction for LTC with MAPE
percentages of 0.2454%, 0.8267%, and 0.2116% for BTC, ETH, and LTC, respectively. The bi-LSTM
algorithm presents the lowest prediction result compared with the other two algorithms as the
MAPE percentages are: 5.990%, 6.85%, and 2.332% for BTC, ETH, and LTC, respectively. Overall, the
prediction models in this paper represent accurate results close to the actual prices of cryptocurrencies.
The importance of having these models is that they can have signiﬁcant economic ramiﬁcations
by helping investors and traders to pinpoint cryptocurrency sales and purchasing. As a plan for
future work, a recommendation is made to investigate other factors that might affect the prices of
cryptocurrency market such as social media, tweets, and trading volume.

1. Introduction
Cryptocurrency is a virtual or digital currency used in ﬁnancial systems [ 1,2]. It is
secured by cryptography that makes it impossible to be counterfeited or double-spent.
Furthermore, it is not issued from a central authority or central banks, and it is decentralized
virtual currencies that can be converted via cryptographic procedures [3] and this make
it distinguishable from traditional currencies. The other feature is that it is created by
technology called blockchain [4], which is an extremely complex, and aims to storing data
that makes it difﬁcult or impossible to alter, hack, or defraud the system. Bitcoin has begun
to carve out a niche for itself, which may either help cryptocurrencies to gain widespread
acceptance or be the major cause of their demise. Cryptocurrencies are still in their infancy,
and it is difﬁcult to predict whether they will ever be widely used in global markets or
not [5]. The most prominent cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, was established in 2009 and for more
than two years was the sole Blockchain-based cryptocurrency. Today, however, there are
over 5000 cryptocurrencies and 5.8 million active users in the cryptocurrency industry [6].
Because of its intrinsic nature of mixing encryption technology with monetary units, Bitcoin
has recently gotten a lot of attention in the disciplines of economics, cryptography, and
computer science [7].
Blockchain (BC), the technology that underpins the Bitcoin cryptocurrency system, is
widely seen as critical in providing the backbone for assuring greater security and privacy

in a variety of other ﬁelds, including the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem. It is mainly
a digital ledger of transactions that is distributed across the entire network of computer
systems on the blockchain [8,9]. The blockchain consists of two fundamental components;
the ﬁrst one is a transaction, and the second is a block. The transaction represents the action
triggered by the participant, and the block is a data collection that records the transaction
and additional details such as the correct sequence and creation timestamp. Blockchain
have a signaling system (BloSS) of multi-domain, blockchain-based, cooperative DDoS
defense system in which each autonomous system (AS) joins the defensive alliance [10].
Reference [11] reveals that the effects of networks on competition in the nascent cryp-
tocurrency market over a period of time regarding exchange rates among cryptocurrencies
depends on two aspects: (1) competition among different currencies and (2) competition
among exchanges. There are hundreds of cryptocurrencies, but Bitcoin is the most popular
one as it is a stubborn competitor and did not emerge out of the cryptocurrency competition
track. As a result, it has become the dominant cryptocurrency. The authors of [12] describe
the competition between cryptocurrency as “healthy competition” and suggests that new
technology and security innovation. The authors of [13] reveal that Bitcoin and national
currencies show volatility shock transmission, while economic policy uncertainty has little
effect. The authors of [14] investigate the interaction between big data and cryptocurrency.
One of the most appealing marketplaces for ﬁnancial speculation is the cryptocurrency
market, which means that deceptive activities have ﬂourished via social media. Many
people have reaped a lot of proﬁts through speculation in the digital markets, but every
investment process suffers from many hidden risks and some investors, particularly those
with a high risk tolerance, are interested in investing in cryptocurrency. Therefore, market
analysts and speculators rely on prediction [15,16]. With variations in predictive power
per cryptocurrency, machine learning and artiﬁcial intelligence algorithms are moderately
appealing [17]. Low-volatility cryptocurrencies are more predictable than high-volatility
ones. There is evidence that the usefulness of different information sets varies between ma-
chine learning algorithms, implying that prediction is likely to be much more complicated
when a set of machine learning algorithms is used [ 18]. Despite the widespread use of
cryptocurrencies for various types of purchases and transactions around the world, there is
no consistent opinion on the deﬁnition of cryptocurrency or its legal status [19]. Further-
more, the aforementioned situation exacerbates challenges in criminal investigations of
cryptocurrency-based money laundering. As a result, law enforcement organizations are
having difﬁculty pinpointing criminals’ identities and proving that they have committed a
crime [20]. Focusing on Bitcoin pricing is similar to stock pricing: none of the risk variables
that explain stock price movements apply to cryptocurrencies. Furthermore, traditional
macroeconomic variables such as currency rates, commodity prices, and macroeconomic
factors that affect other assets have little to no impact on most cryptocurrencies [21]. As a
result of the cryptocurrency market’s surge in 2017 [22], various governments across the
world have begun to move toward standardizing and overseeing digital money. Because
of the security of blockchain technology and their economic environment, people have
become more conﬁdent in using Bitcoin [ 22]. Although the blockchain provides a high
security ecosystem, the research area surrounding the legality of cryptocurrency cannot
be isolated from the people who utilize cryptocurrencies for illicit purposes. The legality
of cryptocurrencies has been the subject of numerous debates. The authors of [ 23] dis-
cuss the perspectives and the nature of cryptocurrencies in terms of monetary features,
legal considerations, economic considerations, and Sharia considerations. Based on the
perspective and characteristics of traditional currency, cryptocurrency does not satisfy the
characteristics of a currency from an economic standpoint.
There are hundreds of cryptocurrencies in digital markets, but Bitcoin is the most
popular and is affected and interacted with by external inﬂuences such as the news, social
media, and small cryptocurrencies that have a limited market share, which are often not
taked into account from investors and traders. Due to the strong relationships between
cryptocurrencies, the smaller ones have become a source of shocks that can positively

or negatively affect other cryptocurrencies. The authors of [ 24] reveal that gold as an
independent currency can be used as a good hedging instrument to decrease the risk
related to unexpected movement in the cryptocurrency market.
Cryptocurrency prices are difﬁcult to forecast due to price volatility and dynamism.
Around the world there are hundreds of cryptocurrencies that clients use. In this paper,
we focus on three of the most popular ones. As a result, the paper aims to achieve the
following by using deep leaning algorithms, which can discover hidden patterns from data,
integrate them, and create far more efﬁcient predictions:
• Presenting a comprehensive study of the various existing schemes to predict the prices
of BTC, ETH, and LTC cryptocurrencies.
• Using AI algorithms such as LSTM, bi-LSTM, and GRU to accurately predict the prices
of cryptocurrencies.
• Utilizing long short-term memory (LSTM), a deep learning algorithm, and Fbprophet,
which is an auto machine learning algorithm, for prediction.
• Evaluating the proposed hybrid models using evaluation matrices such as RMSE and
MAPE for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin.
The main idea behind these models is to achieve a reliable prediction model that
investors can rely on based on historical cryptocurrency prices. Moreover, the paper aims
to answer the following research questions: ‘How can machine learning algorithms help
investors and decision makers to predict cryptocurrency prices?’ and ‘What is the best
model for predicting future cryptocurrency prices?’
This section provides an overview of cryptocurrencies and the remainder of the paper
is structured as follows: Section 2 describes the literature review and previous work in
this ﬁeld, Section 3 presents the modeling results and the statistical analysis of the data,
Section 4 describes the used dataset, Section 5 illustrates the experimental results, Section 6
presents a comparison between the model proposed in this paper and those of other studies
in the literature, and Section 7 summarizes the overall conclusions of the paper.
2. Literature Review
Machine learning (ML) is a type of artiﬁcial intelligence that can predict the future
based on past data. ML-based models have various advantages over other forecasting
models as prior research has shown that it not only delivers a result that is nearly or exactly
the same as the actual result, but it also improves the accuracy of the result [25]. Examples
of machine learning include neural networks (NN), support vector machines (SVM), and
deep learning. The authors of [ 26] demonstrate that incorporating cryptocurrency into
a portfolio improves its effectiveness in two ways. The ﬁrst is to reduce the standard
deviation, and the second is to provide investors with more allocation options. The best
cryptocurrency allocation was reported to be in the range from 5% to 20%, depending on
the risk tolerance of the investor. The authors of [27] focus on time series data forecasting in
particular and apply two machine learning algorithms, random forests (RF) and stochastic
gradient boosting machine (SGBM). The results show that the ML ensemble technique can
be used to anticipate Bitcoin values.
The decision-making process needs to make the appropriate decision at the right time,
reducing the risks associated with the investment process. In [28], a hybrid cryptocurrency
prediction system based on LSTM and GRU is presented, focusing on two cryptocurrencies,
Litecoin and Monero. The authors of [ 29] use minute-sampled Bitcoin returns over 3 h
periods to aggregate RV data. A variety of machine learning methods, including ANN
(MLP , GRU, and LSTM), SVM, and ridge regression, were used to predict future values
based on past samples, which are compared to the heterogeneous auto-regressive realized
volatility (HARRV) model with optimized lag parameters. The ﬁndings show that the
suggested system correctly predicts prices with high accuracy, indicating that the method
may be used to forecast prices for a variety of cryptocurrencies. The authors of [30] employ
the traditional support vector machine and linear regression methods to forecast Bitcoin
values. This research takes into account a time series prediction made up of everyday

Bitcoin closing prices for the creation of Bitcoin prediction models. The authors of [ 31]
used machine learning techniques to address both a multiple regression technique that
relies on highly correlated characteristics and a deep learning mechanism that uses a
conjugate gradient mechanism in conjunction with a linear search for BTC price prediction.
In [32], the price movements of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple are analyzed. The authors
utilize powerful artiﬁcial intelligence frameworks, including a fully linked artiﬁcial neural
network (ANN) and a long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network, and they
discovered that ANN relies more on long-term history, whereas LSTM relies more on short-
term dynamics, implying that LSTM is more efﬁcient at extracting meaningful information
from historical memory than ANN. The study in [ 33] on Bitcoin daily price prediction
with high-dimensional data reveals that logistic regression and linear discriminant analysis
achieve an accuracy of 66%. On the other hand, surpassing (a sophisticated machine
learning algorithm) outperforms the benchmark results for daily price prediction, with
statistical techniques and machine learning algorithms having the greatest accuracies of
66% and 65.3%, respectively. The study in [34] examines the use of neural networks (NN),
support vector machines (SVM), and random forest (RF). The ﬁndings demonstrate that
machine learning and sentiment analysis may be used to anticipate cryptocurrency markets
(with Twitter data alone being able to predict speciﬁc coins) and that NN outperforms the
other models. In [35], the LSTM model is used to predict and ﬁnd methods for forecasting
Bitcoin on the stock market through Yahoo Finance that may predict a result of more than
12,600 USD in the days after the prediction. Due to the importance of the development of a
robust and reliable method for predicting cryptocurrency prices, researchers have focused
on more innovative models. In [36], both linear and non-linear time-series components of
the stock dataset were used for forecasting using the hybrid model. In the non-linear time
series forecast, CNN and Seq2Seq LSTMs were successfully coupled for dynamic modeling
of short- and long-term dependent patterns. The study in [ 37] focused on social factors,
which are increasingly being utilized for online transactions throughout the world, by using
a multi-linear regression model and that analyzes two big capital market cryptocurrencies,
BTC and LTC. The authors of [37] found that the R2 scores were 44% for LTC and 59% for
BTC. Ref. [38] used two different LSTM models (a standard LSTM model and an LSTM
with an AR(2) model). This study presented a forecasting framework, using an LSTM
model to forecast Bitcoin daily prices. The study in [38] found that the model with AR(2)
was better than LSTM with an RMSE of 247.33. Researchers in [39] compared three different
models (ARIMA, LSTM and GRU) for predicting BTC’s price. The experimental outcomes
in [39] showed that ARIMA achieved the best performance with a MAPE of 2.76% and
RMSE of 302.53. The study in [40] presented two types of prediction models constructed
using Bayesian optimized RNN and LSTM to predict the price of BTC. The study revealed
that LSTM showed better performance and achieved an accuracy of 52% and RMSE of 8%.
The investment process mainly depends on the historical price of a cryptocurrency.
One of the most important strategies that the investor depends on is building Markov
chains. This strategy consists of multiple decision trees that are used to identify the
cryptocurrency that is estimated to provide a greater return when sold and then comparing
the estimation with the actual ﬁgure [ 41]. Due to the importance of prediction in the
investment process that many people depend on to earn revenue, this paper focuses
on three models that can predict future cryptocurrency prices using machine learning
algorithms and artiﬁcial intelligence approaches to achieve accurate prediction models
with the aim of helping investors.

of the data) is form 22 October 2020 until 30 June 2021. Then, after training the models
we tested them. Then, we extracted and compared the results and selected the best model
depending on the daily closing price.

3.1. Machine Learning Algorithms 
This section demonstrates three types of  machine learning algorithms—long short-
term memory (LSTM), bidirectional LSTM (bi-LSTM), and gated recurrent unit (GRU). 
3.1.1. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) 
For various learning issues involving sequential data, recurrent neural networks with 
long short-term memory (LSTM) have emerge d as an effective and scalable approach. 
They are useful for capturing long-term temporal dependencies since they are generic and 
effective [43]. The LSTM is an RNN-style archit ecture with gates that govern the flow of 
information between cells. The input and forget gate structures can modify information 
traveling along the cell state, with the ultimate  output being a filtered version of the cell 
state based on context from the inputs [44]. The LSTM design has been criticized for being 
ad hoc and for having a large number of co mponents whose purpose is not immediately 
clear. As a result, it is unclear whether the LSTM is the best design, and it is likely that 
better ones exist [45]. Figure 5 illustrates the structure of a LSTM algorithm [46].

traveling along the cell state, with the ultimate output being a ﬁltered version of the cell
state based on context from the inputs [44]. The LSTM design has been criticized for being
ad hoc and for having a large number of components whose purpose is not immediately
clear. As a result, it is unclear whether the LSTM is the best design, and it is likely that
better ones exist [45]. Figure 5 illustrates the structure of a LSTM algorithm [46].

where it, ot, and ft denote the activation of the input gate, output gate, and forget gate,
respectively; Ct and ht denote the activation vector for each cell and memory block, respec-
tively; and W and b denote the weight matrix and bias vector, respectively. In addition,
σ(◦) denotes the sigmoid function [47].
3.1.2. Bidirectional LSTM (bi-LSTM)
bi-LSTM was created by Schuster and Paliwal [48] to train a network utilizing past
and future input data sequences. The input data are processed using two linked layers [49].
Bi-directional LSTM predicts or tags the sequence of each element using a ﬁnite sequence
based on the context of elements in the past and future. This is the result of two LSTMs

running in parallel, one from left to right and the other from right to left. The forecast of
a given target signal is known as composite output. This method has proven to be quite
beneﬁcial. The forward function of bi-LSTM with inputs of L units and H as the number
of hidden units is calculated using Equations (6) and (7), Figure 6 shows a bidirectional
LSTM structure [ 50]. The hidden layer of the bi-directional LSTM network saves two
values. A participates in the forward calculation, and A transpose is involved in the reverse
calculation. The ﬁnal output value, y, depends on A and A transpose [51]:

5. Results 
This section shows the results obtained from long short-term memory (LSTM), gated 
recurrent unit (GRU), and bidirectional LSTM (bi-LSTM) algorithms using three types of 
popular cryptocurrency: BTC, ETH, and LTC. For each model, the results are illustrated 
in Tables 2–4. The model that gives the lowe st RMSE and MAPE is considered the best 
model. Based on this criteria, all of the models applied to three types of currencies can be 
considered good models but the GRU was found to be the best of the three. The RMSE of 
the GRU model is the lowest. Thus, GRU is more capable of predicting long-term depend-
encies as compared to LSTM and bi-LSTM. This is due to the dependency on past prices. 
Figures 11–19 illustrate the comparisons betw een the actual and the predicted results. 
Simulation results from those models indicate that there are few occasions where the fore-
cast result differs from the actual results.

Therefore, GRU is more capable of predicting BTC trends than LSTM or bi-LSTM, with a 
small difference between it and the LSTM mo del. Figures 11–13 show a visual represen-
tation, comparing the actual and predicted values of the training dataset of the three mod-
els for BTC. 
Results presented in Figure 11 compare the actual and LSTM-predicted price of BTC.

the entire interval. This model is considered the second-best model. The mean absolute 
percentage error for the prediction model (MAPE) of BTC for LSTM is 1.1234%, and the 
root mean square error (RMSE) is 410.399. Statistical analysis of the data indicates that the 
predicted price has a mean value of 38,173.258 USD, a maximum value of 64,358.805 USD,

USD. The mean difference between the mean values of the actual and the predicated 
prices is 76.13 USD.

BTC using the GRU model. The graph shows that the difference between the predicted 
and the actual price is virtually non-existent along the testing set, with very small differ-
ences in the top few peaks of the time series. This model is considered to be the best. The 
mean absolute percentage error for the prediction model (MAPE) of the GRU model for 
BTC is 0.2454%, and the root mean square error (RMSE) is 174.29. Statistical analysis of 
the data indicates that the predicted price has a mean value of 38,333.36 USD, a maximum 
value of 63,870.605 USD, and a minimum value of 12,936.112 USD, whereas the actual 
price has a mean value of 38,249.388 USD, a maximum value of 63,380.999 USD, and a 
minimum value of 12,941 .0 USD. The mean difference between the mean values of the 
actual and the predicated prices is 83.97 USD.

dicted price of BTC under the bi-LSTM model. It indicates a greater difference between 
the actual and the predicted price compared with the LSTM and GRU models. The mean 
absolute percentage error prediction model (MAPE) from bi-LSTM for BTC is 5.990% and 
the root mean square error (RMSE) is 2927.006.  Statistical analysis of the data indicates

Table 5 shows a comparison between the proposed model in this paper and other
models in the literature [ 45,51,53]. The MAPES values of the proposed model in this
paper for GRU predicting LTC represents the best performance compared to all other
models as the predicted results are very close to the actual results. Results obtained from
this paper show that the GRU performed better when predicting the price of all types of
cryptocurrency than the LSTM and the bi-LSTM models.
7. Conclusions
In this paper, three types of machine learning algorithm are constructed and used for
predicting the prices of three types of cryptocurrency—BTC, ETH, and LTC. Performance
measures were conducted to test the accuracy of different models as shown in Tables 2–4.
Then, we compared the actual and predicted prices. The results show that GRU outper-
formed the other algorithms with a MAPE of 0.2454%, 0.8267%, and 0.2116% for BTC, ETH,
and LTC, respectively. The RMSE for the GRU model was found to be 174.129, 26.59, and
0.825 for BTC, ETH, and LTC, respectively. Based on these outcomes, the GRU model
for the targeted cryptocurrencies can be considered efﬁcient and reliable. This model is
considered the best model. However, bi-LSTM represents less accuracy than GRU and
LSTM with substantial differences between the actual and the predicted prices for both
BTC and ETH. The experimental results show that:
• The AI algorithm is reliable and acceptable for cryptocurrency prediction.
• GRU can predict cryptocurrency prices better than LSTM and bi-LSTM but overall all
algorithms represent excellent predictive results.
In future work, we will investigate other factors that might affect the prices of the
cryptocurrency market, and we will focus on the effect that social media in general and
tweets in particular can have on the price and trading volume of cryptocurrencies by
analyzing tweets using natural language processing techniques and sentiment analysis.
